# Global_Vaccien_Tracker_Dashboard

## A data visualization project using Tableau to explore people vaccinated can provide valuable insights into the progress of vaccination efforts, areas where more resources may be needed, and potential relationships between vaccination rates and other factors such as economic strength.

- People Partially Vaccinated: This refers to the number of individuals who have received only one dose of a two-dose vaccine, or have received the first dose of a single-dose vaccine. This metric can be useful in understanding the progress of vaccination efforts, as it can help identify where more resources or outreach may be needed.

- People Fully Vaccinated: This refers to the number of individuals who have received all doses of a vaccine according to the recommended schedule. This metric can be used to assess the overall level of protection within a population.

- Share of People Not Vaccinated over Population: This refers to the percentage of the total population who have not received any doses of a vaccine. This metric can be useful in understanding the level of vaccine hesitancy or resistance within a population.

- Vacc vs Fully Vacc per location: This refers to a comparison between the number of people who have received only partial doses of a vaccine versus those who have received all recommended doses. This can be useful in identifying areas where completion rates are low or where more education or resources may be needed.

- Vaccination per Hundred - Map: This refers to a visual representation of the percentage of the population in each geographic location who have been vaccinated. This type of map can help identify areas where vaccination rates are high or low, and can help focus efforts to improve vaccination rates in areas with lower coverage.

- Vaccinated over GDP: This refers to a comparison of the level of vaccination coverage in a population with the economic strength of that location. This metric can help identify potential relationships between economic factors and vaccination rates.
